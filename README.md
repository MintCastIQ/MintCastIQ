# MintCastIQ
Welcome to the MintCastIQ project!   This repository will soon host the core documentation and contributor guides for building a resilient, audit‑grade trading card inventory manager complete with scan ingest and prediction with > 98% confidence. This is not a marketplace, there are many of those. This will tell you what card you have. 

MintCastIQ is a **web‑first platform** designed for resilient, audit‑grade trading card workflows.  Originally prototyped as an Android app, MintCastIQ has shifted focus to the web, with a mobile companion planned for the future.
